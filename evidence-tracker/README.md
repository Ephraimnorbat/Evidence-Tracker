The primary goal of this project is to address the issue of evidence tampering in court proceedings, ensuring the integrity of evidence files and preventing unjust incarceration.
  
  *Features*

Immutable Evidence Uploads: Investigators can securely upload evidence files to the blockchain, ensuring that once uploaded, the files cannot be tampered with or altered.

Unique ID Generation: Each evidence file is assigned a unique identifier (ID) upon upload, allowing for easy tracking and retrieval.

Access Control: Only authorized personnel, such as judges and prosecutors, have the permission to access the uploaded evidence files. This ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the evidence throughout the legal process.
